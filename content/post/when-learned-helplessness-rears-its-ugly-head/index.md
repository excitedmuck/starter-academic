I don't honestly remember what I had read in the book. You know, that famous book the Martin Seligman had written on positive psychology. '[Authentic Happiness](https://amzn.to/34ROyS2)'. ( It is a best seller.. if that helps) ((actually i don't really know. It's pretty famous though... because the dude who wrote is the head of the American Psychological Association)). 

I had read this book a little of 2 years back when covid had just hit, in the beginning of 2020. This was when things had gotten bad with my models for finding meaning in the world. Its a convulated way of saying my pre frontal cortex fossilised to make me contemplate and empathise with birthdeathdays. Or nonbeing days. Or wanting to bring nonbeing day (death day) closer.

Chatting with a friend reminded me of the details I had read in that book. It mentioned the fact that the biology of learned helplessness is pretty clear... family traits (tree!!)  matters. The locus of control you have in your life, even if you're pretty smart, is going to be hugely dependent (but not solely because the weather in the genes is always 'cloudy with a chance of luck') on the mating choices of your parents. You inherit the good, and the bad from you're particular darwinian life branch. It makes it pretty intense of a read to have that kindof determinism thrown at your face... but inherently we all know that its pretty unlikely that a two donkey's birth a lion. Maybe a horse is more believable, however a lion? It's pretty unlikely that the gene mutation that goes on in the mitosis process is going to make you an einstein if you're parents were skinning dragons in mordor.

The point is... that an apple does not fall far from a tree. Yes... we do have control of our locus (the sense of agency that determines how hard you like to work and whether you think your actions can actively change your surroundings), but it is only so much control in that a goat can call itself free if it were tethered to a tree by a finite length of a rope. Duh... the goat can decide how far it wants to stretch the rope to go look for greener pastures. However it isn't really freedom... it's like telling a person in jail that they can walk in the cell. The metaphorical tether by everyone's neck... is genes. It's a hard pill to swallow because what you are saying that most life outcomes are heavily predicated on you having the right genes that were valued that particular evolutionary time in society. In the 1800's savannah.. that was athletic ability. In 2022, it probably cognitive ability. 

That tether by everyone's neck puts an upper bound to achievement, and the book by Seligman gave wonderful, academically rigorous and captivating accounts the scientific method applied in cornering the traits behind a person's wellbeing. It was a wonderful book. But for someone who went to the book looking for counterfactuals to the immense despair arising from accepting the tether of genetic determinism, it probably wasn't the most prudent of reads. Funnily enough, the subjunctive is the most illogical place to be, so i will say, 'no regrets'.
