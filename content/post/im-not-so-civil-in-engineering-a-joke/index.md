Well well. You know when you get immersed in a topic so deep that your crazy mind tries to find word associations and puns and you are kind of sad that the only one laughing at them is your self. So here we go, I am sharing them so that we can all laugh together. Warning… they’re bored lines…

* Why was the slab mourning?\
  It was carrying a dead load.


* Why do complex numbers keep on falling down?\
  They don’t have real roots.
* Why don’t Newton’s equations for motion smile?\
  They are modelling.
* What did the aggregate say to the cement?\
  I am fine.
* What is the time when someone sits on a beam?\
  A Bending moment
* Why was the floor blushing?\
  The ceiling had a beam
* Why are pin joints so busy?\
  Don’t even have a moment
* Why do lawyers hate clay?\
  Take long for settlements.
* Why did the geotechnical engineer call the ambulance?\
  The soil was at its critical state.
* Why was the foundation sick?\
  It had piles
* Why did the civil engineer start playing music at the construction site?\
  The piles were bored
* Why did the river go to hell?\
  It was dammed
* What did the pile say to the engineer?\
  Stop boring me
* Why did the truss cry?\
  It was dismembered.
* How do we know loam soils are intelligent?\
  They are highly graded.
* What disease do reports suffer from?\
  Appendix-itis
* Why did the freezing researcher go to the abstract?\
  It was summer-ary.
* Why did Elizabeth dig a borehole?\
  To figure out Darcy’s law
* What was the weather in the atom?\
  Cloudy with a chance of electrons.
* What did the Geotech guy say to the borehole?\
  Are you well?
* What did the dissolving salt say?\
  Don’t disturb, I am concentrating
* Why did the fourier transform get hot flushes?\
  Reached its menopause after so many periods…
* Why did the slab go to jail?\
  Too many load cases
* Court to mathematician : Why do you want a divorce?\
  Mathematician: Coz we just have a hyperbolic relationship\
  Court: What?\
  Mathematician: We never meet at ground 0
* Where do reports get their existential crisis?\
  In the abstract
* What did the linear say to the cubic?\
  “You’ve got nice curves”
* A civil engineer walked into a bar, and died.
* Why did e^x die in the market? It couldn’t be differentiated
* What did the Taylor’s series say to the mathematician?\
  “You’re deriving me crazy”
* So why did Taylor get a speed ticket?\
  He was deriving unlimited.
* Why did w become y’s x?\
  They just weren’t coordinates.

Don’t be uncivil… after all I did use Eurocode to prevent their structural failure but Brexit happened.
