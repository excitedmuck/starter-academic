I was asked to write 300 words on how I would change the world using nanomaterials (max 300 words)Â ... This is what I came up with

It just needs a look over the first results of google with the keywords 'environment, nanotechnology' to raise so many eyebrows and potential fireworks in thinking nanotechnology is the panacea to the climate crisis. For people who are so far steeped into food insecurity, who are at the brink of losing their homes, who do not have the luxury of switching to their holiday home or fashioning up a yacht to deal with having their basements flooded and who, above all, are desperately looking for hope and respite in an increasingly bleak dystopian novel of 100 million climate refugees by 2050, this google search means hope. 

I do not know whether making environmentally friendly conductor inks in an organism; Metalchemy born of the same one that discovered the Nobel gases (UCL) will make a tangible difference to the horrendous images of starving polar bears, but in a world where all meaning and hope is at the brink of dissolution and all you can do to keep a clean conscience for a nephew who you just took into your arms is interning for that startup, you bet I will give it my heartfelt shot. With little desire to make this an elegy about Our Planet earth, and every cell in this frustrated college graduating child and beneficiary of the fruits of ingenue of some parts of society, I am eager to make a difference and see my labour amount to a drop as far as existence in a rock hurling at millions of miles a second in an inconsequential galaxy has any meaning. 

Exploring the ability to use nanotechnology to reduce the carbon and the chemical footprint of the various manufacturing processes of the myriard of goods that give us so much convenience would be a worthy way to spend time. I hope working in the midst of people sharing my sentiments in Metalchemy could feel like getting to know a Jack in the drowning Titanic, but who knows, we might fix the ship.
