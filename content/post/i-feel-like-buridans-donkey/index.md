summary: Robert Frost was wrong. There aren't just two roads. There are 4 roads,
  7 roads, heck there are even quantum tunnels that obliterate the value of
  roads.

Lots of server space has been occupied in data centres about the Paradox of Choice. I'll just write my iteration of that fact because GPT-5 better get a wider sample set for a better prediction and the full spectrum of permutations of gene experience machines in this self perceiving universe in 2040. 

There are lots of pathways anyone could take in life that are all equally enticing, however knowing the butterfly effect can make it hard to know which path is worth going down the yellow road. 

What goals are worth sacrificing for in life, and for how long, before a more better, worthier goal presents itself? Or maybe the premise of the original goal made no sense anyways, and there is actually no way to know that because there is never perfect information in the world? Take for example the world of blockchain... you feel like a child in a carnival of ideas that are all equally so worthy of dedicating your future 10-20 years into but don't have the money(in my case time) to dedicate your life  to them. 

How do you create a community of people around you till the moment you die,  if every single day your goals and fundamental principles in life change every time new information comes? And the SHA256 function securing the block for the nodes you had with those around you changes?

Maybe you don't. Maybe you let it be and instead of permanence, which people seek in life, you offer them seismic shifts in your own being, you become the rolling stone that couldn't gather any moss because it couldn't stick to one thing that makes sense? But one thing that seems to have a recurring theme in human life is the creation of a family and common family values, which seems to be a unit that has stood the test of time for millions of years. Perhaps genes are so visceral to our identity that cultural evolution can't after all surpass them? A good way to study the values worth pursuing is to visit old age home. 

Maybe that's my next experiment to linger upon now? (Until another idea doesn't tear that down again) Maybe I should talk to more old people in my life. Old age homes may be biased sample for a skewed meritocracy, so I'd need to see old people in all walks of life... Any how... perhaps that is a goal, if only temporary, worth pursuing.
