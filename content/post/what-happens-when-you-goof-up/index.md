Its 2022 now. Time to Reflect on my failures. 

Lots of Death Anxiety in people's mind. Reassessments of life and more. Some projects I started this year.

\- A book written by GPT-3 prompted by me. (Called Go Party Tripping- 3)

\- A podcast called 'When I look up'.

\- A trial for a dropshipping website course.

\- Music theory to become a professional pianist by the time I am 30. 

\- Giving 1.4k pounds to a secure my bank account, only to find out I was bogeyed. 

\-  A personal website where I write down what it is to live in London. 

\- A blog that got 10 followers, 50 likes on word press at its peak.

\- A youtube channel on mental health.

\- A group called London Technology Society where the plan was to gather people.

\- Becoming a PhD Student in AI and ML applied to Climate Science. 

\- Turning my house into a Airbnb for extra cash.

\- Reading a book every 4 days. 

\- Creating friendships with people who would be happy to be saying goodbye to me on my death bed. 

\- Trying to become a song writer and jazz beats producer on Soundcloud. 

\- Cooking (success!) for people in order to socialise and create a sense of community. 

\- Becoming a TIME Wonderland Staker in order to make my rent for the next 6 months. 

\- Learning how to socialise with posh people. (Don't know how that went, i mostly messed that up)

\- Writing on linkedin, one article about Mental Health and Depression. 

\- Writing a PhD proposal on the Use of AI in Food Security issues. 

\- Starting a podcast for mentoring people. 

\- Volunteer with Climate Change.AI and AAKA Space Architects to be part of the future Martian Colonies.  (Met the founder).

\- Trying affiliate marketing website.

\- Starting a medium blog.

WOAHHH!! I reached my goal of 21 Goals! (k admittedly it took 21.3 goals.. but its still something;))

Non materialised failures:

\- Giving money to a girl child in Uganda so as to save her future. 

\- Being part of a Blockchain Startup to see where the stuff goes
