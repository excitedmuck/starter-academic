I am soon turning 21. Its a scary age to arrive at, especially when you are unsure about what your purpose is in the world. We all know the value of failure, well at least in the motivational self help improvement sense. We are told and perhaps even know that failure is actually the stepping stone to success.  However, I am not sure as a society we have yet accepted failure, it is still something that is looked down upon, without much respect... think about the failure of having a good Brexit deal for instance, or of the fact that that friend of yours got another rejection when he applied for job. 

Or that coding class you started but never finished and are too embarassed by your own lack of conscientiousness, or in my case, the fact that I wanted to make this website for 2 months in the lockdown but kept on getting lost in endless scrolls on the internet or getting depressed about the absurdity of existence and inevitability of climate change and the arctic melting before I get a chance to see it. I think all forms of personal failings are instructive, therefore to remove my own stigma against failure and the fact that I don't really end up finishing everything I start, I have decided to document and write 21 failed projects. My goal is to start 21 projects, and fail all of them. If they succeed, like this website has (finally made itttt), I will add one more project to start on, till have 21 failures. 

Hear hear..., I want to fail 21 projects. Successful projects will be counted as failures in this case. So the incentive to fail is going to be astronomical, I presume which will allow me to start on the projects that have actually the worst chance of succeeding, therefore will lower the barrier to entry. It's going to be a brain bomb of absurd ideas.
