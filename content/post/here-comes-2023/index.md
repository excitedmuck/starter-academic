I﻿ did start a podcast. (Albeit in the chaos of a dysfunctional laptop, stolen phone and 2 months of travel, I didn't get time to upload more than 1 episode. More are on the way though)

B﻿ut most of all, i did end up getting a PhD in Geospatial Sciences.  I am living my dream, and I have a few feathers of other caps to be grateful to. I still can't believe an actual living breathing human being is paid to study. I mean... that's crazy. Wonderful. Amazing. And something that can revolutionize an idealist's life. Is revolutionizing an idealists' life. 

T﻿hank God for the existence of the UK. Objectively, we've done great as a country, driving innovation and research forward, spreading the torch of knowledge and making the world reach for the stars. Can't believe I can actually work in a space port from here.  Or think about the next Martian and moonbase we are to build.
