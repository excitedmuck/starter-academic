Hey! I am an Delay Analyst in the Construction industry. I have a background in Civil and Environmental Engineering from University College London. Iâ€™m interested in blockchain, climate change, climate modelling, applications of AI and Machine learning in climate problems, fluid dynamics, turbulence, wakes behind bluff bodies, geophysics, engineering geology, SpaceX, Nature paper surfing, paleobiology, evolution, Darwin, Math, music, eco-social sustainability, science communication and twaddling some guitar strings. 
Curiosity kills just cats, not humans ;)
