With the increased effects of climate change becoming more apparent worldwide, the latest research in the scientific community seems to be pessimistic in humans managing to keep warming under 2 ̊C. We must identify the components of society it is most likely to affect and how the apparent subsequent non-linear effects may precipitate these harms which society has so far failed to mitigate. One critical concern in current food security models is the sub optimal attention paid to ‘tipping points’ in the earth’s climate system, or events that could trigger warming feedback loops. Food security is a big part of global stability, and recent studies have shown that telekinetic events threatening the stable crops of maize, rice, wheat in the major food baskets of the world. By investigating the underpinnings of many climate models in literature and studying their weak points, the Big Data deluge in Spatio-Temporal Analysis from satellite data could be used as an opportunity to use Machine learning and other forms of artificial intelligence to make better predictions of crop yields/ failure risk. This can help inform policymakers to implement appropriate strategies to effectively transition to more reliable food provision systems such as aquaponics and vertical farms and implement principles of Climate Smart Agriculture to improve adaptation and resilience of communities.
